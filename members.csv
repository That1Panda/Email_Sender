I want to help juniors and make a positive change in the place and in the people around me, help them to be better and benefit them and from them. 
I want to make a change at my circle which will make a change in a bigger circles and affect many other people until we can make a bigger change and change the world to be a better place.
I want to know more about myself, my skills, my passion and be a better version of me.","Organiser at Egypt Career Summit'21 (registration team) and 20 (sessions team)
HR recruiter at MECA ASU'20
Management director at connected family'20
Ambassador at career 180
Event managers' head at connected family'19
Organiser at Employment Fair ASU'19
Event manager at connected family'18","I failed in an interview for a workshop i was really passionate about and i didn't pass, so i waited for the feedback to know my points of weakness and worked on it then applied for the workshop the following year and passed all the phases.","I wanted to be an interior design for so long so i joined faculty of engineering for the architecture department but unfortunately my grades at the first year didn't help me to join it so instead i joined civil department. At first it was hard for me to change my plans and i was disappointed but then i realized that i wouldn't have made it through the architecture department and that my place now is that best scenario that could happen to me. Civil department gave me the free time i needed to join many student activities, workshops and many experience that really helped me to be a better person and know more about my passion.","The accomplishment that i am really proud of is my committee when i was the head of event management committee. I believe it was a great year for me and them by helping them to know more about their skills and develop it through the year. Also we had a great bond between us that helped us to be friends and a family for three years now.","ممكن نقسم المشاكل لكذا جزء،
 أول جزء التعليم: بيحتاجوا ياخدوا قرارات مصيرية زي الكلية والمجال اللي حابيين يكملوا فيه باقي حياتهم في سن صغير فبيبقوا محتاجين يفهموا ويسمعوا عن كل الكليات والمجالات ويعرفوا مهارتهم وهم ممكن يبقوا شاطريين فيه عشان الاختيار يبقى على أسس صحيحة وبيبقوا محتاجين في الفترة ديه يكتسبوا مهارات جديدة تسهل عليهم حياتهم مع بداية الحياة الجامعية.
تاني جزء المجتمع: ممكن يكونوا بيتعرضوا لضغط المجتمع انهم يكونوا شبه اللي حواليهم في قوالب معينة او يتعرضوا للتنمر.
طبعا غير مشاكل المراهقين مع أهلهم
","احسن طريقة هي ان نفهم اختلافاتهم و طريقة التعامل المناسبة لكل شخصية و نبقى دايما مستعدين نسمعهم ونتناقش معاهم بالطريقة اللي تتناسب معاهم ونديهم مساحة وثقة للتعبير عن نفسهم وعن آرائهم وأفكارهم ونشجع أفكارهم الإيجابية ونساعدهم ينفذوها وياخدوا هم قرارتهم ويبقوا مسئولين تماما عن نتايجها."," نساعدهم يتعلموا مهارات جديدة زي الpresentation skills والleadership skills ويحسّنوا مهارات التواصل بتاعتهم من خلال انهم يتعاملوا مع ناس مختلفة ويكوّنوا صداقات ويعرفوا ازاي يعبروا عن نفسهم ويقدموا نفسهم بشكل كويس.
نساعدهم يوصلوا للشغف بتاعهم وانهم يتعلموا حاجات مع نفسهم ويقدروا ينفذوا أفكارهم.
نرفع وعيهم الذاتي وفهمهم لنفسهم ومهارتهم عشان ميتأثروش بأي حاجة تحصل حواليهم.
نعرفهم الفرق بين الحياة قبل الجامعة وبعدها وازاي يطلعوا بأكثر استفادة من فترة الجامعة.","Zoom meetings with activities and interaction involved (questions&answers and rewards, online games), whatsapp groups to follow up together all the time.","هتبقى تجربة فريدة من نوعها جدا إني أقدر أقدم المساعدة اللي كنت محتاجاها في السن ده للناس اللي فعلا محتاجينها. 
جربت أشرح قبل كده وكنت مبسوطة  ​بالتجربة ولاقيت نفسي وحابه إني أحضّر محتوى مفيد وأعرضه تاني بعد ما اتعلم أعمل ده بشكل صح.","https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1LorlTTzWD8BoA2ca-ntFhdK7Y11kA7fn"

I believe succeeding or failing is about any life experiences. One significant time was one my first university tests. Afterwards I started improving myself and seeking help from my colleagues and staff, and kept improving and progressing and adopted the mindset ""Progress is SUCCESS"" and now I became one of the top students and am a much better learner.","Several personality traits of mine used to be different several years ago. I was determined to change a lot of my character traits. To do so, I had to remain calm in situates where I'd be angry and aggressive. Tried to become a better daughter and sister, and a better friend to myself and to all my lovely friends and colleagues. I'm grateful for who I am today because I changed in many positive ways and always try to be the better version of myself.","

- إقامة مبادرة رد الجميل على مستوى مدرسة الأوقاف الثانوية بنات 2019.
- المشاركة في نموذج القاهرة الدولي للأمم المتحدة بالجامعة الأمريكية 2019.
- إقامة مباردة ما وراء الكواليس على مستوى مدرسة ","في 3 إعدادي حصلت على مجموع 299.5/300 وكنت قدمت في مدارس STEM الـ هي كانت المدرسة الـ إخواتي اتقبلوا فيها من قبل، ورغبتي إني أقدم فيها كانت إني أتواجد مع إخواتي والنظام هناك كدراسة كان مختلف وجميل، بس ربنا أراد إني متقبلش فيها، وقتها حسيت بالشعور ده، ولكن وقتها بردو كان عندي تفهم إن فيه قدامي فرص كتير وإن الدنيا واسعة الحمد لله، وقد كانت بداية إني أتدرج بقى في الاتحاد الطلابي وأوصل لمستوى جمهوري في المرحلة الثانوية، وبردو ربنا رزقني بأوقات جميلة أوي قدرت فيها إني أطور نفسي في التعامل وفي الفهم وفي مختلف الأنشطة، وكانت حصيلة السنين ديه أنا بس بأسلوب وفهم مختلف وعلاقاا جميلة وطيبة وذكرى لطيفة أفهم منها دائمًا إن رب الخير لا يأتي إلا بالخير.","أعتقد إن أكبر تحدي بالنسبالي كان وأنا لسة بادئة المرحلة الإعدادية، وقت ما إخواتي الكبار دخلوا مدارس داخلية في المرحلة الثانوية، الـ هو بيشترط إن السكن بيكون في المكان الـ بتتواجد فيه المدرسة، وبسبب تعلقي الشديد بإخواتي كان ده أكتر وقت حسيت فيه بالوحدة، وأنا عمري ما كنت وضعت في موقف زي ده من قبل، وقتها قررت إني مسيبش نفسي للحزن وأنغلق، ووقتها اشتركت في الأنشطة الطلابية في المرحلة الإعدادية كلها وبدأت إني أشغل وقتي ونفسي، وأعتقد إن ده كان بداية دخولي مجال الأنشطة الطلابية والمسابقات والـ بفضل الله حققت فيها مراكز كويسة على مستوى المحافظة، وإني أحاول أستثمر شعوري في حاجات تجعل ليا دور فعال في مكان ما بتوفيق ربنا، وكان ده دافع ليا دايمًا إني أجرب حاجات جديدة ووقتها فعلًا اتعلمت الخط العربي لحبي الشديد له واتعلمت الرسم، الحمد لله السنين عدت واجتمعنا من جديد على خير.","سؤال زي ده بيجعلني دايمًا في حيرة شديدة لأمور كتير أوي، لأن نظرتي للإنجاز مش بتبقى متعلقة بأمر ما فقط، يعني مثلًا الحمد لله بتوفيق ربنا ولطفه قدرت إني أتخطى مرحلة الثانوية العامة الـ هي سنة 2020، كانت صعبة عليا خالص من ناحية إني فقدت خالتو صفاء حبيبتي رحمها الله وغفر لها وكانت قريبة إلي وقريبة إلى فؤادي دائمًا، ومن ناحية إني وقع عليا ظلم كبير في تصحيح امتحانات الثانوية العامة وبعد ما عملت إعادة تصحيح فضل الأمر زي ما هو، فالفترة ديه كانت بالنسبالي بؤرة سوداء وكادت أن تلتهم جزء كبير مني، ولكن بفضل الله الإنسان لما بيقعد مع نفسه في جلسة مع الذات كدا ربنا بيلهمه الصبر والرضا، ومع وجود أهلي وثقتهم في ودعمهم الدائم الغير مشروط، توصلت إن الحياة أوسع بكتير من كدا، وإني مظلمش نفسي لأن في قرارة نفسي الحمد لله عملت كل ما في وسعي ولكن ما قدر قد كان، فبالتالي مطلوب مني فقط الصبر والرضا، والحمد لله قد كان، وبعد دخولي الجامعة ربنا يسر لي أموري فيها طبعًا مع كثير من الانطفاء والقليل من التخبطات والانغلاق نوعًا ما، 
ربنا أكرمني وحصلت على امتياز في سنتي الدراسية الأولى مع ترتيب على الدفعة وده كان تعويض","أعتقد هي نظرتهم للدراسة بإنها أول وآخر ما قد يهمهم، وإنها تمنعهم من إنهم ينموا مهارتهم الحياتية، وتمنعهم عن أمور كتير تضيف لهم وتصقل من شخصياتهم.
وأعتقد بردو جزء منهم بيبقى غير قادر إنه ينظر للأمور بالشكل الصائب وبالقدر الملائم لها، والافتقار لتحديد الأولويات في الحياة سواء من الجانب العاطفي أو الدراسي وغيره كتير، وأعتقد بردو نظرًا لعصرنا الحالي وكثرة الخيارات الـ بتبقى قدامهم فبيكونوا في حالة من التشتت بين إيه أفضل لهم وهكذا، وأعتقد بردو عدم مقدرتهم على اختيار الوسط الـ يضعوا نفسهم فيه سواء أصحاب أو مكان ما.","أعتقد عن طريق فهمهم، فهم هم عاوزين إيه، بيتطلعوا لإيه، إيه المشاكل الـ بتعوقهم، إيه الحافز الـ ممكن أدعمهم بيه، وشعورهم دايمًا إنك داعم لهم بيكون سبب في إنك تتفاهم معاهم بيسر نوعًا ما.","إن الحياة أوسع من مرحلة معينة، الحياة مليئة بالفرص التي لا تعد، الـ معرفتش تحققه في وقت معين تقدر تحققه فيما بعد، إنك لازم تخوض تجارب كتير وتستفاد منها وتضيف لها، تفهم الـ قدامك، حدد أنت عاوز أثرك يكون إزاي؟، أمور كتير أوي لازم تنظر لها في نفسك وتقعد من وقت لآخر جلسة حديث مع الذات وتشوف أخطأت في إيه وتحاول تصلحه، وتسامح نفسك والـ حواليك، وتجرب تقرأ في مختلف المجالات.","
عن طريق الـ Platfroms المختلفة.
حاليًا الموضوع لو حصل فهو هيكون حله بإذن الله أيسر عن الأول لأن فيه سابق  تجربة.","أعتقد إنه مدى حبي للتعامل مع الفئة السنية الأصغر مني سنًا دائمًا وإحساسي بالقرب منهم، ورغبتي في إنهم يكونوا قادرين على فهم نفسهم واستيعابهم لمدى قدراتهم في أمور كتيرة.","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ikhquTLT0Nalu-bUmaoRx0vOK9cjTEzP/view?usp=drivesdk"
